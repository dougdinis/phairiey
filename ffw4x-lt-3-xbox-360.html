Hi fellow swappers! This is my first ever completely custom computer build, and it has been in the works since May of 2018. It was officially completed last week, and now I need to find a good home for this beatiful machine. amp#x200B; The specs are as followed: CPU/GPU - Ryzen 5 2400g - Bought brand new from Newegg in July of 2018, but it wasn't used until August.

Please click the hyperlinked titles That's how it works in Guitar Hero 3 with the regular xbox 360 controller (not the guitar controller): Green: LT Red: LB Yellow: RB Blue: RT Orange: A But no matter what I do, I can't seem to map any command to LT or RT. I've tested the controller and those triggers are working fine (actually they do work in the game, you can test it in when you try to calibrate the controller). I'm probably the minority here, since most of you seem to be playing on guitar controllers. My arcade stick was built when the Xbox 360 was peak technology using a scavenged board from one of its controllers. The face of it has 6 buttons that go X/Y/LB on the top row, A/B/RB on the bottom row. I use a pretty reasonable control scheme consisting of X = FP, Y = BP, LB = block (that's the top row), then A = FK, B = BK, RB = interact (that's the bottom row). This game has some extra inputs that make use of certain buttons that I don't have mapped on this stick, or are mapped inconvenient. So I decided to try out a Fightstick and got a used Madcatz Fightstick Pro (Xbox 360 Variant). In SFV's training mode I need the L3/R3 buttons to reset/restart, which this stick doesn't have. So I tried to rebind LB and LT to the Stick buttons in 360ce without sucess. In 360ce the input is displayed as I want it, but in the game the buttons act like on a normal 360 controller. Help would be greatly appreciated! amp#x200B. So, i've been on a crusade to play KOTOR 2 because the game outright won't work with my laptop; i decided that the best course of action was to download an ISO and then burn it into a DVD to play in my Xbox 360 (KOTOR 2 is in the compatible list, and my LT. 3.0 chipped 360 can run classic xbox games, even burned ones). The problem came when i tried finding an ISO file for KOTOR 2; i can't seem to find a file that's just the ISO and nothing else, every source that has it gives Hey all, So I've decided to give the Souls trilogy another run through and I'm having issues with my Xbox One Controller on DS. Seems to only let me use the DPAD and LTampRT along with the actual buttons (Y, X, A, B) as well as the right joy stick for camera movements. It doesn't let me use the left joy stick to move, or RBampLB. I've installed the 360 controller driver, xbox one driver. Windows is identifying it as an Xbox One Controller, have no issues with it on DS2amp3. Does anyone. March has been a really consistent month. I have and a fair share of happenings towards the end of the month but managed to finish my goals for the most part I had set in line Saints Row, and Forza Horizon as my main focus. I managed to get another quick runner in as well that being the PS4 plus free game MW Remastered which was a driving point with a friend that use to play way back in the day on 360. The reason I post for the most part is Forza Horizon technically isn't finished however. 
As the title says, my new build is dropping a siginificant amount of frames across all titles whenever my Xbox One S controller is connected via bluetooth. I couldn't quite understand why my computer would drop frames on a game like Darksiders Warmastered Edition which it should be playing with ease, until I started doing a little troubleshooting to eliminate factors. I've narrowed it down to the Xbox One S controller. When the controller is connceted, via bluetooth, it causes lagging and frame. Hey guys, I've figured out how to use any hotas for the game HOWEVER, there are a few limitations: For me I had to omit camera controls (only complete look back on either side) and Yaw is not an axis but an on/off switch for either direction, I have potential solutions for these though, I recommend UCR over x360ce as x360ce doesnt even work properly with AC7 and it is also much much more versatile and you can set up much more intuitive controls with it. Alright So I decided to replay AC 2 but im having some major issues with my controls, I have tried with a wired xbox 360 and my ps4 controller. I can't map anything to LT/RT on either controller. With AC 2's horrible pc port using a keyboard is not acceptable. I have tried using several different mappings from steam community etc and have also tried to use DS4 for the playstation controller. On the PS4 controller (haven't checked this on xbox) R2/L2 is for some reason used to look to the right Let me be the first to say how excited I was for this HOTAS and AC7, and how extremely disappointed I was with the HOTAS. I had plenty of time using it as I ended up playing (via PCSX2) AC04, AC5, AZC, Project Wingman, and War Thunder. As much as I wanted to like it, the HOTAS itself gave me tremendous amount of stress on PC. So much trouble that I ended up returning it this morning. I had the PS4 version, but this is a PC review for it. First, let me start with the pros: - It looks great. I'm new to Cemu. Im using myXBOX 360 to emulate controller for Wii U Pro Controller with DirectInput API. Somehow when I play TLOZ: The Wind Waker HD(My only game in Cemu yet) z targetting(LT button or ZL button) while using RT button/ZR to use a sheild, it cancels both buttons. It works fine in my Citra Emulator. Hey guys. Apart from what I said in the title, I was hoping for some troubleshooting help. Just got myself this " Rock Candy Controller for Xbox 360 (https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Candy-Wired-Controller-360-Blueberry/dp/B00M7ZJ2LY/)", and while I got it working using `xboxdrv`, some buttons seem to have been jumbled. When I first press RT the knight looks down, and upon releasing RT it keeps looking up until I press it down again (likely being read as y axis of right stick). Apart 
Be sure to have the 'use gamepad' setting on \ in the bar in the top left of the screengtcontroller icon\ Step 1.
